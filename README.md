# Ray-Tracer optimization assignment
This project is an assignment from the Chaos algorithmic course.
The task is to build a better accelerator structure than the given Octree to optimize the render time of the ray tracer.

# This repo is a fork of urban-spork

Tiny raytracer used for base code for intersection acceleration structures

Most of the code is from [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](http://www.realtimerendering.com/)

Some of the mesh/bouding box intersections are from Veselin Georgiev's great [raytracer](https://github.com/anrieff/quaddamage)
